I'll start with 
Onboarding experience

Nothing major has happened this week, we added one new flow that appears when you opel H5P.com via LTI and the purpose is to introduce the user with "Reporting" feature.

We made a (temporary) Layout Builder team that will work more closely on Layout builder project.

So going forward - Gwen, Runar, William and Morten will  be more focused on Layout builder project. This week they did a lot of planing on the issues that should be included in the next sprint.

This week we officially started with implementation of the new theme. Content type we focused on this week was Flashcards and we'll continue on it next week too.
